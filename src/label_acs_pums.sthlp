{bf:label_acs_pums} {hline 2} Label American Community Survey PUMS data.



{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
{bf:label_acs_pums} labels American Community Survey  {browse "https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/pums.html":public use microdata} using information compiled from the ACS PUMS  {browse "https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/pums/data_dict/":data dictionaries}.

{p 4 4 2}
The program automatically caches the retrived data dictionary and labels. To avoid downloading and generating the files each time, specify the {it:use_cache} option. If you do not specify {it:use_cache}, or if you have never run {bf:label_acs_pums} for the year and sample specified, you must be connected to the internet to use this program.

{p 4 4 2}
The variable and value labels generated by this program are not a substitute for the original data dictionary: they may be truncated and some important notes may be excluded.
