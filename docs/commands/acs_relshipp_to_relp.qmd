## Description

`acs_relshipp_to_relp` converts `relshipp`, the household relationship variable in ACS microdata from 2019 to present, to `relp`, the relationship variable in earlier samples.

In a dataset containing only `relshipp`, `acs_relshipp_to_relp` will recode `relshipp` to generate `relp`.

In a dataset containing both `relshipp` and `relp` (for example, a dataset formed by appending 2019 or later and 2018 or earlier samples), `acs_relshipp_to_relp` will, for observations where `relp` is missing and `relshipp` is not, populate `relp` with recoded values of `relshipp`.

By default, `acs_relshipp_to_relp` will create a value label for `relp` if one does not already exist.
