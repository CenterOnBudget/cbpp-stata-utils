## Description

`generate_ind_sector_var` generates a categorical variable for 22 industry sectors representing 2-digit [2017 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes](https://www.census.gov/naics/?58967?yearbck=2017).

In ACS microdata, the variable `indp` must exist.

In CPS microdata, by default, the variable `peioind` must exist and the new variable will reflect the primary job worked last week. Users may specify `job(year)` to indicate the new variable should reflect the longest job held last year, in which case `industry` must exist.

::: callout-caution
Not all ACS or CPS data years use the 2017 NAICS. This command will not work properly for data years that use other NAICS versions.
:::

The 2-digit NAICS codes define 22 industry sectors. The CPS's major industry recode variables `a_mjind` and `wemind` define 14 industry groups. In the ACS, 18 industry groups are represented by three-letter abbreviations at the beginning of the industry variable `indp`'s value labels.
