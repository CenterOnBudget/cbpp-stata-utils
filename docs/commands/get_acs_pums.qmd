## Description

`get_acs_pums` downloads [American Community Survey public use microdata](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata.html) CSV files from the Census Bureau FTP and converts them to Stata's .dta format.

If `state()` is not specified, the program will retrieve the national dataset. Downloading the data for the entire U.S. can take several hours. The national dataset is split into several CSV files. `get_acs_pums` appends them into a single .dta file.

Datasets will be saved in "acs_pums/\[year\]/\[sample\]\_yr" within the current working directory (the default) or in another directory the user specifies with the `dest_dir()` option. For example, `get_acs_pums, state(vt) year(2022) sample(5) record_type(h) dest_dir(my_data)` would save files in "my_data/acs_pums/2022/5_yr", creating intermediate directories as needed.

State .dta files are named the same as the original CSV files: "psam\_\[record_type\]\[state_fips_code\]" for 2017 and later, and "ss\[year\]\[record_type\]\[state\]" for earlier years. National .dta files are named "psam\_\[record_type\]us.dta" for 2017 and later, and "ss\[year\]\[record_type\]us.dta" for earlier years.

If `year()` is 2013 or later, datasets will be labeled with information from the ACS PUMS data dictionaries by default.
