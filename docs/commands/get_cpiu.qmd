## Description

`get_cpiu` retrieves annual average CPI-U (the default) or [R-CPI-U-RS](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/research-series/r-cpi-u-rs-home.htm) (formerly CPI-U-RS) data series from the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm). The series may be loaded as a variable joined to existing data in memory, as a matrix, or as a new dataset replacing data in memory.

Users may request inflation adjustment factors based on the retrieved price index be generated. Inflation adjustment factors are used to convert current (nominal) dollars into constant (real) dollars. The `base_year()` option specifies which year to use as the base year for the inflation adjustment factor. For example, `get_cpiu, base_year(2022) clear` will load into memory the CPI-U data series as variable `cpiu` and generate `cpiu_2022_adj`. Users may then multiply a variable containing nominal dollar values by `cpiu_2022_adj` to obtain the values in 2022 constant dollars.

Data series are automatically cached. Users can load the cached data rather than re-downloading it by specifying `use_cache`. Note that price indices are occasionally back-revised. When loading cached data, `get_cpiu` will display the date when the was originally downloaded. To refresh the cached data with the latest available data, run `get_cpiu` without the `use_cache` option.

## Syntax

``` stata
get_cpiu, { merge | matrix(matname) | clear } [options]
```

| Option               | Description                                                                                                                                                |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `merge`              | Merge the data into the dataset in memory.                                                                                                                 |
| `matrix(matname)`    | Load data into matrix *matname*.                                                                                                                           |
| `clear`              | Load the data into memory, replacing the dataset currently in memory. Cannot be combined with `merge`.                                                     |
| `rs`                 | Retrieve the R-CPI-U-RS. If unspecified, the CPI-U will be retrieved.                                                                                      |
| `base_year(integer)` | Create inflation-adjustment factors from nominal dollars to real dollars, using the specified base year.                                                   |
| `yearvar(varname)`   | If `merge` is specified, the key variable on which to merge the data into the dataset in memory. Default is `yearvar(year)`.                               |
| `nolabel`            | Do not attach variable labels to the retrieved data. May only be specified with `merge` or `clear`.                                                        |
| `use_cache`          | Use data from the cache if it exists. An internet connection is required to retrieve data when `use_cache` is not specified or cached data does not exist. |
| `user_agent(string)` | Email address to provide in the header of the HTTP request to the BLS website; passed to [copy_curl](copy_curl.qmd).                                       |
