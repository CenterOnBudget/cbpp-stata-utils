## Description

A cross between `summarize` and `inspect`, `inspect_2` gives the frequency of positive, zero, negative, and missing values in a variable, as well as the mean, minimum, and maximum value of a variable within those categories and overall.

Results may be stored in a matrix (or matrices, if `varlist` is multiple variables) by specifying matrix name(s) to `matrix()`.

## Syntax

``` stata
inspect_2 varlist [if] [weight], [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|----|----|
| `matrix(matname)` | Store results in matrix *matname*. If multiple variables are specified in *varlist*, a list of matrix names in which to store the results. |

: {tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}

`fweight`s and `iweight`s are allowed.

## Examples

Inspect a single variable

``` stata
inspect_2 thnetworth
```

Inspect multiple variables, storing the results in matrices.

``` stata
inspect_2 pincp_adj pernp_adj, matrix(pincp_mat pernp_mat)
```
