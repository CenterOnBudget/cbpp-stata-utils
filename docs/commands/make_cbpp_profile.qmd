## Description

`make_cbpp_profile` creates CBPP's standard [profile.do](https://www.stata.com/support/faqs/programming/profile-do-file/) in the user's home directory.

CBPP's standard profile.do defines global macros that serve as shortcuts to synced cloud folders and cloned GitHub repositories:

-   `odpath` – Path to the user's OneDrive, "C:/Users/{username}/OneDrive - Center on Budget and Policy Priorities".

-   `sppath` – Path to the directory for synced SharePoint folders, "C:/Users/{username}/Center on Budget and Policy Priorities".

-   `spdatapath` – Start of path to a synced datasets libraries, "C:/Users/{username}/Center on Budget and Policy Priorities/Datasets - ".

-   `ghpath` – Path to cloned GitHub repositories, "C:/Users/{username}/Documents/GitHub".

Users may optionally add the following to the standard profile.do:

-   Census Bureau API key to for use by the [getcensus](https://centeronbudget.github.io/getcensus/) package, to be stored global macro `censuskey`.

-   Path to the user's Rscript excutable for use by the [rscript](https://github.com/reifjulian/rscript) package, to be stored as global macro `RSCRIPT_PATH`.

The standard profile.do includes `set more off, permanently`.
