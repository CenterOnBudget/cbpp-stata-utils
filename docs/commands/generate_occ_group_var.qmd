description: |

categories: ["ACS and CPS microdata utilities"]

## Description

`generate_occ_group_var` generates a categorical variable for major occupation groups representing 2-digit [2018 Standard Occupational Classification System (SOC) codes](https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/major_groups.htm).

In ACS microdata, the variable `occp` must exist.

In CPS microdata, by default, the variable `peioocc` must exist and the new variable will reflect the primary job worked last week. Users may specify `job(year)` to indicate the new variable should reflect the longest job held last year, in which case `occup` must exist.

::: callout-caution
Not all ACS or CPS data years use the 2018 SOC. This command will not work properly for data years that use other SOC versions.
