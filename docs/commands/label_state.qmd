## Description

`label_state` attaches value labels to a variable containing [state FIPS codes](https://www.census.gov/library/reference/code-lists/ansi/ansi-codes-for-states.html). Value labels are the full state name by default. The 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories are supported.

If the state FIPS code variable in *varname* is a string, it will be destringed.

## Syntax

``` stata
label_state varname [, options]
```
