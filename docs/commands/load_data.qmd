## Description

`load_data` loads CPS, ACS, ACS SPM, SNAP QC, or Household Pulse Survey microdata from a CBPP datasets library into memory.

To use `load_data`, first:

-   Sync the datasets library to your laptop.

-   Add CBPP's global macros to your `profile.do` with [`make_cbpp_profile`](make_cbpp_profile.qmd).

Multiple years of data may be loaded at once by specifying a list of years to the `years()` option. Variable and value labels from the maximum year will be retained.

When loading multiple years of ACS data, if the range of `years()` spans the introduction of string characters to `serialno` in 2018, `serialno` will be edited ("00" and "01" will be substituted for "HU" and "GQ", respectively) and destringed.

## Syntax

``` stata
load_data dataset [if], years(numlist) [options]
```

where *dataset* is one of "cps", "acs", "acs-spm", "qc", or "pulse" (case insensitive).

| Option             | Description                                                                                                             |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `years(numlist)`   | Year(s) of data to load. When *dataset* is "cps", `years()` refers to the survey (data release) year.                   |
| `vars(varlist)`    | Variables to load; default is all.                                                                                      |
| `weeks(numlist)`   | Alias for `years()`; for use when *dataset* is "pulse".                                                                 |
| `period(integer)`  | With *dataset* "qc" and `year(2020)`, period of data to load: 1 for the pre-pandemic period or 2 for the waiver period. |
| `saveas(filename)` | Save dataset to file.                                                                                                   |
| `replace`          | When `saveas()` is specified, replace existing dataset.                                                                 |
| `clear`            | Replace the data in memory, even if the current data have not been saved to disk.                                       |
